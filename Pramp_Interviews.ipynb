    "Let document consist of of N words where M of them are unique (M ≤ N). \n",

    "2) sorting the [word, occurrence] pairs by the number of words’ occurrences \n",
    "in a descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: we tokenize document into words by using whitespaces as delimiters.\n",
    "For each word, we clean it from all non-alphabetic characters (digits, punctuation etc)\n",
    "and convert it to lowercase to make counting case-insensitive. In this part, you should \n",
    "be leveraging whatever parsing capabilities your programming language of choice is \n",
    "providing. There is really no point of implementing functions that already exist.\n",
    "As for counting, we’ll use a Map (Hash Table) to store words and their corresponding \n",
    "occurrences. A map is optimal in this case because it allows us find, store and\n",
    "update operations in O(1) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: as for the sorting part, rather than sorting the entries in the map\n",
    "directly, which takes O(M⋅log(M)) - where M is number of unique words in \n",
    "document - a better solution will be to place words into an array of string\n",

    "the number of unique words in it (M ≤ N). Iterating over all words,\n",
